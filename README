This is my configuration for fvwm.  It straightforwardly does what I
want/need, with no fancy stuff.  I'm providing it as an example for
people to get started creating their own configuration.

Before using it, go through the individual files and check for things
you may need to change.  In particular, you probably want to change
some key-/mouse bindings and perhaps some fonts.  I've put comments
into the files to make these places easier to find.

You probably want to modify 'fvwm-menudefs.fvwm' to insert the
programs you frequently use.

If you use emacs, there is an fvwm-mode available somewhere which
helps a great deal with editing these files.  You may also want to use
multisearch from [1].
